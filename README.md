# aobaJigSol
AobaJigSol is a mobile/tablet app using camera vision to guide physical jigsaw puzzle assembly. It scans the box image and individual pieces, suggesting optimal placement and orientation. It tracks progress, offers hints, and allows mid-game scans, enhancing the puzzling experience while preserving the challenge, all on-device for privacy.
